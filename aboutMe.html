		A wizard with a spreadsheet, and a sorcerer with a six-string; it has been said that Nathan Thomas' talent is without limits. As his editor, arch-nemesis, and good friend, I've had the priviledge to witness his twisted genius first-hand. I can assure you that his abilities, both wickedly awesome and subtly seductive, are the result of years of pain-staking practice, and not any sort of deal with satan as so many rumours purport. Although, to spend such an amount of time alone with his guitar, away from family and friends, jamming to Clapton backing tracks in his musical lair, has caused me at times to question the man's mental state. I'm sure it's not unusual behaviour for a music afficionado, but the question lingers in my mind: could a sane man be insanely good at soloing?<br><br>
		I don't mean to slander the public image of Mr. Thomas, he really is a dear friend, and the work he's done lately reviving old rock classics on his youtube channel is nothing short of saintly. But there are things that I believe the public ought to know. Things I've witnessed and never spoken of. Is he a madman? a saint? or just a really good guitar player? Dear reader, I will share my evidence and you will be the judge<br><br>
		I first became aware of Mr. Thomas' uncanny abilities during a sleep over at his house in grade 9. After several rounds of cognac and, naturally, cigars, he invited me to join him in the upper chamber of his mansion. As I approached the threshold to his inner sanctum, the first thing that struck me was the smell; it was as if there was an intense chemical reaction transpiring behind one of the many closed doors I stumbled past. This would also explain the light-headed feeling that grew stronger as I approached. I reached the door frame and there he was, in a mess of wires and cables he stood, with a Gibson strapped on his shoulder. He looked pale, and his cheeks sunken. "Mr. Thomas...", I said, but he silenced me with a strum of his instrument. I understood he would not be communicating to me with words from that point on, but with his music. His "communication" began as a rant, with his fingers racing up and down the frets frantically like wild dogs on the chase. This chaos continued for several minutes and I admit it had me confused. But just as I was about speak up, and offer that I have my driver take me home, I noticed his eyes slowly roll back in their sockets. For a moment I stared at the pale white where his pupils used to be, then quickly he snapped his eyes shut and his tongue flickered out. The again, and again, like a snake he was smelling the air. I hadn't noticed it was raining, but just then the crack of thunder shook the room, and I tumbled to the floor. As the raucous thunder faded I noticed the notes, once scattered and chaotic, began to organize. His fingers moved so fast, Where my eyes failing me? It seemed as though he had three, maybe four hands at work. From the speaker, music screamed, wailed, and growled. The chords struck me, right hook, left hook, then an upper cut. I writhed on the floor, fighting for my life, when I looked to him, the man who's mercy I was at. His eyes were still closed and the music raged on, pounding me, crushing me, until I lay in the fetal position tossing back and forth. And then everything went black.<br><br>
		When I awoke, I was in my own home. That was '13, and to this day I can't say for certain what happened that night. But what I know for certain is that music has never felt the same from that day on. Now when I listen to Hendrix or Clapton I have to wonder, are these the songs that inspired a mad man?<br><br>
		We still gather occasionally, for drinks n' smokes, but when he asks to play me a song I always refuse. And I always leave before midnight, which is what Mr. Thomas calls "shredding time". I have no reason to believe that's a double entendre, but I have no plans to find out for certain.</p>
